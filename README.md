Travis (version 1.0)
====================

Travis is a taxi lookup and taxi-client manager application that uses an online database for dynamic matchmaking and allows Google Wallet transactions.

Travis does not rely on a unified central system. Instead, it manages free taxi-accounts and client-accounts under an online database, and links these between each other.

The application uses support libraries, allowing it to be compatible with API 7 or higher.


Key points for clients:
-----------------
* find a taxi and set destination addresses using Google Map
* call and arrange rides with taxis with just a few taps
* securely authenticate the taxi you called through NFC cryptographic key 
* pay the fee with traditional means or with Google Wallet


Key points for taxi-drivers:
-----------------
* introduce yourself to a new world of clients that can easily request and schedule rides with you, and all you need is to create a free account and login in the application
